        <p>India is working hard towards protecting its natural assets and sustaining its indigenous cultures. Tourism in India also supports and sustains local economies that are dependent on this revenue, by using local produce and creating economic opportunities for local communities. There are restrictions on the number of people permitted to enter the core area of forests so as not to create disturbance in the life cycle of nature and its wildlife. There is also pressure on hotels to promote recycling, using solar power and water reuse. Holiday camps, eco-friendly resorts in jungles, tree houses in hotels and houseboats run by local people are some of the eco-tourism friendly options in various destinations, offering both luxury and affordable accommodation.</p><br>
